We created a simple Tictac Toe game displayed on an OLED peripheral we used the keypad as inputs which allowed the keypad to map to different coordinates for the ouput of the tictac to 3x3 grid.
We also created a win animation and blinking text for displaying who won or if its a draw 

their was also some code for understanding basic SPI fundamentals and how a master and sub code worked.
