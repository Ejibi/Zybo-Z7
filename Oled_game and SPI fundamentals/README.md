We created a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game displayed on an OLED peripheral we used the keypad as inputs, which allowed the keypad to map to different coordinates for the output of the tictac to a 3x3 grid that was displayed on the OLED.
We also created a win animation and blinking text for displaying who won or if it's a draw 

there was also some code for understanding basic SPI fundamentals and how a master and sub worked.
